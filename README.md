# CrimeDataExplorer

> This project is a simple front-end application that allows users to search and display crime data from the City of Chicago's public API based on a selected crime type.

> !!!Note!!!: This project was built strictly for educational purposes. It does not represent advanced technical skill or prior experience with JavaScript. Instead, this was a hands-on way for me to familiarize myself with JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and basic API interaction.
